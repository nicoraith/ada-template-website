    "### Framing our Research\n",
    "Art imitates life and life imitates art - Cinema has the power to capture the zeitgeist of an era. In this project we will be studying gender representation in cinema to better understand trends in societal sentiments. Our goal is to assess if representations differ by gender and if they have evolved through time. This project is motivated by the fact that the 20th century was a time of dynamic social upheavel and mobility, e.g., in Switzerland, womens sufferage at the federal level was granted as late as 1971.\n",
    "This project is predicated on the idea that character portrayal in cinema serves as a mirror for society, which gave rise to the character. Character focused analysis will lean heavily on Stanford NLP library in order to understand lexical groups by which characters are represented.\n",
